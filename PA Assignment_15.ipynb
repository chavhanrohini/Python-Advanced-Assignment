    "Q1. What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?\n",
    "\n",
    "A1. Python 3.8 introduced several new features and improvements, including:\n",
    "- The \"walrus operator\" (`:=`) for assignment expressions.\n",
    "- Positional-only parameters in function definitions.\n",
    "- Syntax features like f-strings with the `=` specifier.\n",
    "- The `math.prod()` function for computing products.\n",
    "- New syntax warnings.\n",
    "- New built-in modules like `importlib.metadata`.\n",
    "- Syntax and typing improvements.\n",
    "- Various standard library updates and enhancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is monkey patching in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A2. Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of dynamically modifying or extending classes or modules at runtime. It involves making changes to the code of an existing module or class, typically by adding, modifying, or replacing methods or attributes. Monkey patching is often used to fix bugs, enhance functionality, or adapt third-party libraries without directly modifying their source code. While it can be useful, it should be done with caution, as it can lead to maintenance challenges and unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy?\n",
    "\n",
    "A3. The difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy is in how they duplicate the contents of a data structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shallow Copy: A shallow copy creates a new object but does not create copies of nested objects within the original data structure. Instead, it copies references to those nested objects. Modifications to nested objects are reflected in both the original and the copied data structures. In Python, you can create a shallow copy using methods like `copy.copy()` or slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deep Copy: A deep copy creates a completely independent copy of the original data structure, including copies of all nested objects within it. Changes to nested objects in the copied structure do not affect the original, and vice versa. In Python, you can create a deep copy using the `copy.deepcopy()` function from the `copy` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "A4. In Python, the maximum possible length of an identifier (variable name, function name, etc.) is implementation-dependent. However, it is typically recommended to keep identifiers reasonably short and descriptive for readability. Python's official style guide, PEP 8, suggests limiting identifiers to 79 characters for code that is not more readable when lines are shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is generator comprehension?\n",
    "\n",
    "A5. Generator comprehension is a concise way to create a generator in Python. It follows a similar syntax to list comprehensions but generates values lazily, one at a time, instead of creating a list. Generator comprehensions use parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# List comprehension\n",
    "my_list = [x * 2 for x in range(5)]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generator comprehension\n",
    "my_generator = (x * 2 for x in range(5))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, `my_list` is a list, while `my_generator` is a generator. Generator comprehensions are memory-efficient and are useful when you don't need to store all values in memory at once. You can iterate over a generator using a `for` loop or other iterable methods.\n"
