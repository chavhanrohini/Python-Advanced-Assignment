    "Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution is a mathematical function or model that describes the likelihood of various outcomes in a random experiment or process. It specifies the probability associated with each possible value or range of values that a random variable can take. While individual values in a probability distribution are random and unpredictable, the distribution itself provides a framework for understanding and quantifying the uncertainty associated with those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Is there a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers, if there is one? Why are the latter considered “good enough”?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, there is a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers:\n",
    "- True random numbers are generated from truly random physical processes or phenomena, such as atmospheric noise or radioactive decay. They are inherently unpredictable.\n",
    "- Pseudo-random numbers are generated by algorithms and are not truly random. They start from an initial \"seed\" value and produce sequences of numbers that appear random but are determined by the algorithm. Pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" for most applications because they exhibit statistical properties that make them suitable for many purposes, such as simulations, cryptography, and games. However, they are not truly random and can be predictable if the seed and algorithm are known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the two main factors that influence the behaviour of a \"normal\" probability distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main factors that influence the behavior of a \"normal\" probability distribution (also known as a Gaussian distribution) are:\n",
    "1. Mean (μ): The mean represents the central or average value of the distribution. It determines the location of the peak or center of the distribution.\n",
    "2. Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the values in the distribution. A smaller standard deviation results in a narrower, more concentrated distribution, while a larger standard deviation leads to a wider, more spread-out distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Provide a real-life example of a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example of a normal distribution is the distribution of heights in a large population. In such a scenario, the heights of individuals tend to follow a normal distribution, with most people having heights near the mean and fewer people having heights that deviate significantly from the mean. The mean height represents the average height of the population, and the standard deviation represents how much heights vary around that average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In the short term, how can you expect a probability distribution to behave? What do you think will happen as the number of trials grows?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the short term, the behavior of a probability distribution can be unpredictable due to the inherent randomness of individual events. However, as the number of trials (or observations) grows, the distribution tends to converge toward its expected behavior, as described by its probability distribution function. This phenomenon is known as the Law of Large Numbers, and it states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean (average) approaches the population mean, and the sample distribution approaches the population distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What kind of object can be shuffled by using random.shuffle?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `random.shuffle` function in Python can shuffle the elements of a mutable sequence (an object that supports item assignment) in place. This includes objects like lists and arrays. It cannot be used to shuffle immutable sequences like strings or tuples, as they do not support item assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Describe the math package's general categories of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The math package in Python provides various mathematical functions and constants. These functions can be categorized into several general categories, including:\n",
    "1. Basic mathematical operations: Functions for common mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.\n",
    "2. Trigonometric functions: Functions like sine, cosine, and tangent, along with their inverses (e.g., arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent).\n",
    "3. Exponential and logarithmic functions: Functions for exponentiation (e.g., `exp`) and logarithms (e.g., `log`, `log10`, `log2`).\n",
    "4. Hyperbolic functions: Hyperbolic sine, cosine, and tangent functions.\n",
    "5. Special functions: Functions like factorial (`factorial`), absolute value (`fabs`), and rounding functions (`ceil`, `floor`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What is the relationship between exponentiation and logarithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between exponentiation and logarithms is described by the fundamental logarithmic identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "If \\(a^x = b\\), then \\(\\log_a(b) = x\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if you have an equation where a number (a) raised to a certain power (x) equals another number (b), you can find the value of x by taking the logarithm of b with base a.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What are the three logarithmic functions that Python supports?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports three main logarithmic functions in the `math` module:\n",
    "1. `log(x, base)`: Calculates the logarithm of x with a specified base. If the base is not provided, it defaults to the natural logarithm (base e).\n",
    "2. `log10(x)`: Calculates the base-10 logarithm (common logarithm) of x.\n",
    "3. `log2(x)`: Calculates the base-2 logarithm (binary logarithm) of x.\n"
