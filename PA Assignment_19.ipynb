    "Q1. Define the relationship between a class and its instances. Is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many partnership, for example?\n",
    "\n",
    "A1. The relationship between a class and its instances is a one-to-many relationship. A class serves as a blueprint or template for creating multiple instances (objects). Each instance is an independent object with its own state and behavior, but they share the same structure and methods defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What kind of data is held only in an instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "A2. Data held only in an instance is called instance-specific data. It includes attributes that are unique to each instance and can have different values for each object created from the class. Instance data represents the object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What kind of knowledge is stored in a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "A3. Knowledge stored in a class includes class-level attributes and methods. Class-level attributes are shared among all instances and represent shared characteristics or settings for objects of that class. Class methods are functions that operate on the class itself or on class-level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What exactly is a method, and how is it different from a regular function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A4. A method is a function defined within a class, and it is associated with that class. The key difference between a method and a regular function is that a method is called on an instance of the class and has access to the instance's data (via the `self` parameter). In contrast, a regular function is not tied to a specific class or instance and operates independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Is inheritance supported in Python, and if so, what is the syntax?\n",
    "\n",
    "A5. Yes, inheritance is supported in Python. Inheritance allows a class (subclass or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass or parent class). The syntax for creating a subclass that inherits from a superclass is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Subclass(Superclass):\n",
    "    # Subclass-specific attributes and methods\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "A6. Python supports encapsulation through naming conventions. It does not provide strict access control like some other languages. By convention, instance variables and methods that should be considered private are prefixed with a single underscore (e.g., `_private_variable`). However, this is more of a convention, and Python does not prevent access to such variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. How do you distinguish between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "A7. Class variables are shared among all instances of a class and are defined within the class but outside any method. Instance variables are specific to individual instances and are defined within methods using the `self` parameter. Class variables are accessed using the class name, while instance variables are accessed using the instance name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. When, if ever, can `self` be included in a class's method definitions?\n",
    "\n",
    "A8. `self` is included as the first parameter in a class's method definitions to indicate that the method is bound to instances of the class. It should be included in all instance methods (i.e., methods that operate on instance data) to allow access to the instance's data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What is the difference between the `__add__` and the `__radd__` methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "A9. The `__add__` method is called when using the `+` operator with an object as the left operand. The `__radd__` method is called when using the `+` operator with an object as the right operand. `__radd__` is used to support addition when the object on the right does not have an `__add__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. When is it necessary to use a reflection method? When do you not need it, even though you support the operation in question?\n",
    "\n",
    "A10. Reflection methods (e.g., `__str__`, `__repr__`) are used to define how an object should be represented as a string. They are necessary when you want to provide a custom string representation for your objects. However, you don't always need them, especially if the default representation (e.g., memory address) is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What is the `__iadd__` method called?\n",
    "\n",
    "A11. The `__iadd__` method is called when using the `+=` operator with an object. It allows objects to define custom behavior for in-place addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. Is the `__init__` method inherited by subclasses? What do you do if you need to customize its behavior within a subclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "A12. The `__init__` method is not automatically inherited by subclasses. To customize its behavior in a subclass, you can define an `__init__` method in the subclass. To reuse the superclass's `__init__` behavior, you can call `super().__init__()` within the subclass's `__init__` method to initialize the inherited attributes.\n"
